MERN Project Architecture and Flow
1. Overview
This MERN project is a Blog Management System that allows users to:

View blog posts publicly.
Register and log in.
For authenticated users with admin roles: create, update, and delete blog posts.
The application is divided into two main sections:

Frontend: Built with React.js and Redux Toolkit for state management, and styled using Tailwind CSS.
Backend: Built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB for handling business logic and data persistence.
2. Architecture Overview
Frontend Architecture
The frontend uses React for building a dynamic and responsive user interface (UI). It is responsible for handling the interactions with the user, sending requests to the backend, and displaying the response in a user-friendly format.

React Components:

The application is organized into multiple components like Navbar, Home, Login, Register, AdminDashboard, etc.
Components are responsible for displaying UI and handling interactions.
The Navbar component dynamically changes based on the user's authentication status and role (user/admin).
Routing:

React Router is used for navigation between different views (Home, Login, Register, Admin Dashboard).
Protected Routes: Only authenticated users can access certain routes like the admin dashboard using a custom ProtectedRoute and AdminRoute components.
State Management:

Redux Toolkit is used to manage the global state, including authentication (user login details, token storage) and blog posts.
The authSlice manages authentication state, and the blogSlice stores the list of blogs and performs CRUD operations.
Backend Architecture
The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js, following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern for clean and organized code.

Express.js Routes:

The backend exposes RESTful API endpoints for handling various actions like user authentication (/api/users), and blog management (/api/blogs).
There are protected routes for admin users (e.g., creating, updating, and deleting blogs), and these routes use middleware to ensure proper authentication and authorization.
Middleware:

protect Middleware: Ensures that routes are only accessible to authenticated users by verifying the JWT token sent in the request headers.
admin Middleware: Checks if the logged-in user has an admin role and ensures only admins can create, update, or delete blogs.
MongoDB:

MongoDB is used to store users and blog data.
Blog Schema: Contains fields like title, content, author, and timestamps.
User Schema: Stores user details such as username, email, password, and role (either user or admin).
3. Flow of the Application
1. User Authentication and Authorization
Login Flow:

The user logs in by submitting their credentials (email and password) through the Login form.
The frontend sends a POST request to the backend’s /api/users/login endpoint.
The backend authenticates the user, generates a JWT token, and sends it back to the frontend.
The frontend stores the JWT token in localStorage and updates the state via Redux.
The user is then redirected to the homepage or dashboard based on their role (user/admin).
Protected Routes:

The ProtectedRoute component is used to wrap routes that require authentication (e.g., the blog viewing page).
The AdminRoute component ensures only admin users can access the admin dashboard.
2. Blog CRUD Operations (Admin Only)
Create Blog:

Admins can create a new blog by filling out the form in the AdminDashboard.
A POST request is sent to the /api/blogs endpoint, with the blog details in the request body.
The backend verifies the user’s admin role using the admin middleware and then creates the blog in the MongoDB database.
Update Blog:

Admins can edit existing blog posts in the AdminDashboard by clicking the "Update" button.
A PUT request is sent to the /api/blogs/:id endpoint, where the :id is the blog’s unique identifier.
The backend checks if the user is authorized and updates the blog in the database.
Delete Blog:

Admins can delete a blog post by clicking the "Delete" button next to the post.
A DELETE request is sent to the /api/blogs/:id endpoint.
The backend verifies that the user is authorized and deletes the blog from MongoDB using the deleteOne() method.
3. Frontend & Backend Communication
Frontend Requests:
The frontend sends HTTP requests (via Axios) to the backend for authentication, blog management, etc.
The requests contain the JWT token in the Authorization header for protected routes.
The backend responds with the data or status based on the request.
The frontend then updates the Redux state based on the response (e.g., storing the user details or updating the list of blogs).
4. State Management with Redux
Auth State:

The authSlice stores the authentication details, including the user's login status, JWT token, and role.
The loginUser action is dispatched when a user logs in successfully, storing the token and user information in the Redux state.
Blog State:

The blogSlice manages the state for the list of blogs.
The actions fetchBlogs, createBlog, updateBlog, and deleteBlog are used to fetch, create, update, and delete blogs in the state.
4. Flow Summary
A user visits the application.
If the user is logged in, they can view the blog posts.
If the user is an admin, they can access the admin dashboard, where they can create, update, and delete blogs.
The frontend sends API requests to the backend for blog management and authentication.
The backend validates requests using middleware and performs the appropriate database operations in MongoDB.
The frontend updates the UI based on the response (e.g., displaying blogs or showing success/error messages).
